# Arcana_Hackathon
## Arcana Hackathon by ShivaSurya PH21B009 and Juswanth EE21B063
We have done the data analytics part and website part 

Instructions to run the file locally :

### For Analytics Part

1) After unzipping Analytics_code.zip has file structure like :

- &rarr; code

  - &rarr; Transcript_analysis

  - &rarr; data_visualization_LSTM_stock_prediction

  - &rarr; saved models

  - &rarr; dataset

We need not to change anything here

We just need to plave the dataset the folder named 'FMP' -> (contains transcripts) and named 'prices' -> (contains price data) ( all folders and files inside them are named as porvided by arcana hacathon team )

***`Final folder structure should be like this :`***

- &rarr; code

  - &rarr; Transcript_analysis

  - &rarr; data_visualization_LSTM_stock_prediction

  - &rarr; saved models

  - &rarr; AFL_dataset
  
- &rarr; FMP
  
- &rarr; Prices
  
Then all codes **( Transcript_analysis.ipynb and data_visualization_LSTM_stock_prediction.ipynb )** will run properly

### For webpart -> ( To run website locally )

* Install Django 
* run the command 'python manage.py runserver'
